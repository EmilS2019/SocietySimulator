I realized that all the imports must come from a certain direction.

Example:

fileA.py

def something():
   blah blah blah


fileB.py

from fileA import something
def somethingElse():
    blah blah = something()


But you cannot import file B from file A.
If you imagine the entire project as a graph, this means that
the graph will be a directed tree graph. We must avoid
cycles at all costs.
